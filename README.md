# 📚 Google Cybersecurity Certificate – Practical Projects

This repository serves as both a personal portfolio and a study reference for aspiring cybersecurity professionals.

➡️ [Access the course here](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cybersecurity)

Courses 1 and 2 were theoretical, building a foundation in cybersecurity and incident response. From Course 3 onward, hands-on projects demonstrate skills in:

🔎 Incident analysis using NIST

🛡️ SQL filtering for suspicious activity

🐧 Linux file permissions

🔍 Vulnerability assessment (NIST SP 800-30)

🧪 Incident handling with tools like Wireshark and VirusTotal

🐍 Python automation for file updates

Each section includes a summary, key skills, and a downloadable PDF. More content will be added as the course progresses.
